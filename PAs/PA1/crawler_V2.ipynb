by attending classes together and by learning from faculty and each other in academic and social settings. All students enroll in the Core curriculum, designed with the expectation that in the first two years of study a student will complete core requirements and introductory courses in a major. The final two years of enrollment are devoted to advanced work in the major and elective courses that build on the foundation laid in the first two years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In order to engage in this structured plan, students must register full time (with three or four courses) in each quarter of the standard academic year (autumn, winter, spring) for the first two years. Full-time registration allows for completion of the core and introductory courses to the major, and enables students to participate fully in the intellectual life of the College. As young scholars, students test their understanding and perspective across all disciplines in conversation with peers. The community that develops in Housing and in co-curricular student life builds on students\\xe2\\x80\\x99 common experiences in learning and in exploring beyond the classroom. Further, the elements of the Core curriculum provide cross-disciplinary perspectives on enduring questions and create the habits of mind that prepare students for advanced studies.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4>General Information</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The University of Chicago is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In keeping with its long-standing traditions and policies, the University of Chicago considers students, employees, applicants for admission or employment, and those seeking access to programs on the basis of individual merit.

Because the scholarly literature lags behind the pace of transformation in China, we draw on a wide variety of materials: ethnography, memoir, fiction, films, essays, historical studies, short stories, websites. Emphasis in class discussions is on grasping how contemporary Chinese realities are experienced from viewpoints within China—this is the sense in which the course is intensive study of a \"culture.\" Readings and materials are divided into several major units concerned with historical memory, rural China, urban life, labor migration, and popular culture.

This course is an anthropological exploration of this phenomenon that examines: (1) the use of the ancient past in the construction of modern nationalist mythologies of Celtic identity (e.g., in France and Ireland) and regional movements of resistance to nationalist and colonialist project (e.g., in Brittany, Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Gallicia, Asturias); (2) the construction of transnational ethno-nostalgic forms of Celtic identity in modern diasporic communities (Irish, Scottish, etc.); and (3) various recent spiritualist visions of Celticity that decouple the concept from ethnic understandings (e.g., in the New Age and Neo-Pagan movements). All of these are treated in the context of what is known archaeologically about the ancient peoples of Europe who serve as a symbolic reservoir for modern Celtic identities. The course explores these competing Celtic imaginaries in the spaces and media where they are constructed and performed, ranging from museums and monuments, to neo-druid organizations, Celtic cyberspace, Celtic festivals, Celtic theme parks, Celtic music, Celtic commodities, etc.',\n",

We then look at theories of mass media reception and spectatorship that put ideology at the center of their analysis, interrogating theories of the “receiver” of media messages as cultural dope (Frankfurt school Marxism), psychoanalytic and (post-)Marxist theories of spectatorship (“Screen” theory), feminist critiques of film spectatorship, and reactions to the above in cognitivist film studies. We then turn to British Cultural Studies’ theories of media, focusing on how such work attempts to reconcile models of reception as ideologically unproblematic and as determined by the ideological structures of production and reception. Particular focus is given to the theoretical arguments regarding ideology and media, the notion of “code,” and the differences and similarities in the model of communication with the sociology of mass communication. In the second half of the course we look at anthropological approaches to media and how anthropologists have taken up the issue of media reception. Why have anthropologists largely ignored media and reception studies until recently? What kinds of contributions can anthropology make to the theorization and methodological approach to reception? By critically looking at ethnographies of reception, we problematize the concept of reception proper, looking at more holistic ways of dealing with the issue of the mediation of social life. In the final part of the course we re-evaluate what we mean by “mass media” and “reception.” First we look media (con)texts that blur the duality of production/reception. We then consider new forms of media and to what extent “reception” as a category even makes sense in attempting to understand how engagement with such new media functions.',\n",

Whether assailed as the product of colonial orientalism or celebrated as the ur-subjectivity of those who resist it (or something in between), the claims of, to, and about indigeneity continue to excite and demand attention scholarly and political. Indeed some argue that politics of indigeneity have gained unique traction in recent decades, as indigenous actors, scholars, and their advocates have pressed for changes to legal, political, and cultural/scientific regimes that have indigenous affairs as their chief objects of inquiry. One need only consider the 2007 passage of the UN Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, the legal decisions acknowledging the force of native title in the Supreme Courts of Australia and Canada, and even the changes in various regimes of research\\xa0concerning the social scientific study of native peoples and/or the representation of their material culture, all of which happened less than 20 years ago. Despite these long-standing interests and recent social, politica,l and economic gains, indigenous communities remain among the most vulnerable in the world. These trenchant inequalities beg the question, how does the condition of indigeneity relate to the various social forces shaping the world today and to the lived experiences of those who claim to be, or get named as, indigenous. It is towards an exploration of this question that this course is dedicated. Among the lines of inquiry that we will pursue in the course are: (1) tracing the genealogies of indigeneity as a notion, both in Euro-American human sciences and in other epistemological traditions; (2) considering the role that notions of indigeneity play in contemporary national and international political regimes; (3) exploring how indigeneity is claimed or disclaimed, by different peoples around the world, and why; and (4) considering the ways in which notions of indigeneity are being figured in new regimes of possession and commodification, including intellectual property, genetics and genome mapping, and the role of indigenous knowledge in resource extraction and bioprospecting. In pursuing these questions this course will endeavor to tease out the manifold relationships that the rising politics of indigeneity at the dawn of the 21st century has to other global political economic phenomena.\\xa0Simultaneously, the course will also attend to the ways in which different peoples, caught up in different sociopolitical milieu, orient to the notion of indigeneity as it articulates with their lived experiences with matters of autochthony (the state of being “from here”), allochthony (being “from elsewhere”), and the consequences of those distinctions to their everyday lives.',\n",

Declaring, “Indians have been cursed above all other peoples in history. Indians have anthropologists.”(Deloria 1988[1969]: 78), Deloria’s broadside was aimed at a social science academy whose research methods, ethics, and findings he felt offered little concrete benefit to the indigenous peoples whose lives they studied. Whether accurate or not, the critique sent ripples not only through the academy, but through policy circles and the native communities themselves, inaugurating a period of remarkable refiguring of the legal, scholarly, and interpersonal landscapes against which social science research on indigenous peoples is constituted. This refiguring has emerged in a variety of modes and with different effects and outcomes. In this course, students will be introduced to the evolving ethics, methods, policies, and epistemologies shaping social science research with indigenous communities in North America. In addition, in the second half of the quarter, students will get firsthand experience working on issues of relevance to social science research with indigenous communities under the supervision of Prof. Richland and leadership at two institutions in Chicago—the Title VII American Indian Education Program and the North American Anthropology Division of the Field Museum. In this part of the course, students will be paired up and work on independent projects that are designed to address the needs and interests of these organizations and the indigenous peoples with which they work, and then to initiate their own academic inquiry alongside those projects. These projects will provide you with an opportunity to understand and implement the theories, ethics, and methods learned in class, revealing the rewards and challenges of conducting research programs that engage leading theories and debates in the academy while also making real contributions to the indigenous communities with which students are working.',\n",

About Nature starts with critiques of the essentialized Nature in the modernist, theological, and scientific discourses but it directs attention elsewhere: to the zones of writing and practice, academic and activist, professional and popular, where the natural figures through theoretical insights, empirical observations, or in practical problems; where it materializes in sensuous encounters, knowledgeable collecting, or ecstatic experiences; and where it rallies communities of inquiry and interest. We will be interested in popular commitments to natural living and eating, from North American wild fermentation movement to Russian dacha summer gardens and will read about some local traditions and revivals of medicinal, artisanal, and homemade foods. We will ask how are the process of foraging, preparing, consuming, and sharing playing up and reworking locally contingent intimacies between vegetal, animal, and otherwise non-human worlds.

How might these culturally specific accounts be open to comparison and influence new conceptualizations?

A focus of the course is to seek out a possible productive tension between death as a form of cultural representation to those that analyze the making and allowing of life and death.

This course concerns itself with these articulations: (1) the spatial production of social worlds, (2) its expressions in different cultural and historical settings, and (3) its trails of ambiguous effects. Drawing on several fields, anthropology and geography chiefly, but also art history, architecture, philosophy, and social theory, we will explore how the triad of space/place/landscape works on, in, and through different social worlds and its role in the making of social experience, perception, and imagination. We will also reflect on how spatial formations frequently elude the very social projects that have birthed them.

Some of the questions that will guide our discussions include: How do politics work in both past and present? Through what channels and modalities? With what effects (anticipated or not)? And what role does the material world play in mediating these relations? Each week will pair theoretical readings with case-studies drawn from different parts of the world and from different moments in history.
